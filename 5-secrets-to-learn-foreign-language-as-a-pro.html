                                    <h3>5 Secrets to Learn Foreign Language Like a PRO</h3>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Learning a new language is not as difficult as you might have presumed. Infact learning a new language may actually boost your academic achievement in unimaginable ways. Various studies show that kids who grew up in families who spoke a second language at home, scored better in cognitive tests as compared to those who grew up with just a single language.</p>   
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The common believe that children learn languages the best has been proven wrong multiple times, that too by multiple people. However, learning a new language does take a bit of effort to get started. If you are interested in learning a new language then please do remember that you will have to keep yourself motivated throughout your language learning journey. Your motivation decides the fate your your new language.</p> 
                                    <b>So, now once we have understood how easy it is for us to learn a new language, let us dive deeper into the secrets behind learning a new language with ease-</b>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Get Real:</b>
                                            Although it might be tempting to set high goals at first, but don't feel overwhelmed by this, learn at your own pace. Setting an attainable goal will always help you in the long run. According to a famous german translator Judith Matz, you could pick up 50 words of a language and start using them on people- and then slowly start picking up on the grammar of the language. You must also understand that learning a new language takes time and it is not a skill you could learn overnight.</li>
                                            <li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Make language-learning a lifestyle:</b>This tip is extremely helpful for people who wish to learn a language in order to settle in a country or area which speaks the same language. You would definitely not want to lag from your friends just because of a language right? If you are someone who finds themselves here then you could start learning new language by trying to embed it in your everyday lifestyle. You could use sticky notes and put them on objects around your house, all you have to do is write the new word which you were struggling to learn. Now, whenever you reach that object you would recall the word and read the meaning, eventually your brain would recall the word with that object. Experiment with few ways and select a method that works best for you without putting a lot of efforts. You could share few tips in the comments section below to help your peers too! Whichever way you might prefer, remember your consistency of learning will help you the most.</li>
                                            <li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Make technology your bestfriend:</b>We live in technically active world. Technology helps us ease our life in a number of ways so why not utilize it to learn as well. Do take advantage of all the supplies that you could get. You can easily find Ted Talks and various Netflix shows in your desired language, you could also turn on the captions as per your comfort, and the best part.... this is absolutely free. You could also consider listening to foreign language songs to help your pronounce and understanding a few words in a natural way. Infact, listening to songs will also make you learn new words subconsciously.</li>
                                            <li style="text-align: justify;"><b>It's time to increase your friend circle:</b>f you already have friends who are native speakers of your desired language then do ask them for help and try conversing with them in that language, if you aren't that lucky then I have a few more ideas for you! Nowadays, there are a bunch of platforms where you could find a language couch, you could subscribe to such courses online and be in direct contact with a native speaker of the language. You could also find websites and apps online where you can have a language-exchange, you can find a person who is interested in learning a language that you know and in exchange they will help you with a language that they are an expert of. Isn't this a wonderful idea? Do comment below and share your views about these language exchange platforms.</li> 
                                            <li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Make your mistakes your friend:</b>Don't let your fear undermine your destiny. If you have checked through the previous point and found a language buddy then don't feel shy making mistakes while having a conversation with them. The native speaker will not bash you down for a simple mistake, instead they would appreciate your effort and help you through your mistakes. Remember your mistakes are a proof that you are trying. So feel proud of yourself for going this far and keep practicing. If you still feel nervous talking to a peer, then you can test your language skills with someone a little younger to you.</li>
                                        </ul> 
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Being patient throughout your language learning journey is the key. The more you communicate, the closer you'll get to the elusive ideal of "native-like fluency".
